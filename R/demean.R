#' Compute group-meaned and de-meaned variables
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `demean()` computes group- and de-meaned versions of a variable that can be
#' used in regression analysis to model the between- and within-subject effect
#' (person-mean centering or centering within clusters). `degroup()` is more
#' generic in terms of the centering-operation. While `demean()` always uses
#' mean-centering, `degroup()` can also use the mode or median for centering.
#'
#' @param x A data frame.
#' @param select Character vector (or formula) with names of variables to select
#'   that should be group- and de-meaned.
#' @param by Character vector (or formula) with the name of the variable that
#'   indicates the group- or cluster-ID. For cross-classified or nested designs,
#'   `by` can also identify two or more variables as group- or cluster-IDs. If
#'   the data is nested and should be treated as such, set `nested = TRUE`. Else,
#'   if `by` defines two or more variables and `nested = FALSE`, a cross-classified
#'   design is assumed. Note that `demean()` and `degroup()` can't handle a mix
#'   of nested and cross-classified designs in one model.
#'
#'   For nested designs, `by` can be:
#'   - a character vector with the name of the variable that indicates the
#'     levels, ordered from *highest* level to *lowest* (e.g.
#'     `by = c("L4", "L3", "L2")`.
#'   - a character vector with variable names in the format `by = "L4/L3/L2"`,
#'     where the levels are separated by `/`.
#'
#'   See also section _De-meaning for cross-classified designs_ and
#'   _De-meaning for nested designs_ below.
#' @param nested Logical, if `TRUE`, the data is treated as nested. If `FALSE`,
#'   the data is treated as cross-classified. Only applies if `by` contains more
#'   than one variable.
#' @param center Method for centering. `demean()` always performs
#'   mean-centering, while `degroup()` can use `center = "median"` or
#'   `center = "mode"` for median- or mode-centering, and also `"min"`
#'   or `"max"`.
#' @param suffix_demean,suffix_groupmean String value, will be appended to the
#'   names of the group-meaned and de-meaned variables of `x`. By default,
#'   de-meaned variables will be suffixed with `"_within"` and
#'   grouped-meaned variables with `"_between"`.
#' @param append Logical, if `TRUE` (default), the group- and de-meaned
#'   variables will be appended (column bind) to the original data `x`,
#'   thus returning both the original and the de-/group-meaned variables.
#' @param add_attributes Logical, if `TRUE`, the returned variables gain
#'   attributes to indicate the within- and between-effects. This is only
#'   relevant when printing `model_parameters()` - in such cases, the
#'   within- and between-effects are printed in separated blocks.
#' @inheritParams center
#'
#' @return
#' A data frame with the group-/de-meaned variables, which get the suffix
#' `"_between"` (for the group-meaned variable) and `"_within"` (for the
#' de-meaned variable) by default. For cross-classified or nested designs,
#' the name pattern of the group-meaned variables is the name of the centered
#' variable followed by the name of the variable that indicates the related
#' grouping level, e.g. `predictor_L3_between` and `predictor_L2_between`.
#'
#' @seealso If grand-mean centering (instead of centering within-clusters)
#'   is required, see [`center()`]. See [`performance::check_heterogeneity_bias()`]
#'   to check for heterogeneity bias.
#'
#' @section Heterogeneity Bias:
#'
#' Mixed models include different levels of sources of variability, i.e.
#' error terms at each level. When macro-indicators (or level-2 predictors,
#' or higher-level units, or more general: *group-level predictors that
#' **vary** within and across groups*) are included as fixed effects (i.e.
#' treated as covariate at level-1), the variance that is left unaccounted for
#' this covariate will be absorbed into the error terms of level-1 and level-2
#' (_Bafumi and Gelman 2006; Gelman and Hill 2007, Chapter 12.6._):
#' "Such covariates contain two parts: one that is specific to the higher-level
#' entity that does not vary between occasions, and one that represents the
#' difference between occasions, within higher-level entities" (_Bell et al. 2015_).
#' Hence, the error terms will be correlated with the covariate, which violates
#' one of the assumptions of mixed models (iid, independent and identically
#' distributed error terms). This bias is also called the *heterogeneity bias*
#' (_Bell et al. 2015_). To resolve this problem, level-2 predictors used as
#' (level-1) covariates should be separated into their "within" and "between"
#' effects by "de-meaning" and "group-meaning": After demeaning time-varying
#' predictors, "at the higher level, the mean term is no longer constrained by
#' Level 1 effects, so it is free to account for all the higher-level variance
#' associated with that variable" (_Bell et al. 2015_).
#'
#' @section Panel data and correlating fixed and group effects:
#'
#' `demean()` is intended to create group- and de-meaned variables for panel
#' regression models (fixed effects models), or for complex
#' random-effect-within-between models (see _Bell et al. 2015, 2018_), where
#' group-effects (random effects) and fixed effects correlate (see
#' _Bafumi and Gelman 2006_). This can happen, for instance, when analyzing
#' panel data, which can lead to *Heterogeneity Bias*. To control for correlating
#' predictors and group effects, it is recommended to include the group-meaned
#' and de-meaned version of *time-varying covariates* (and group-meaned version
#' of *time-invariant covariates* that are on a higher level, e.g. level-2
#' predictors) in the model. By this, one can fit complex multilevel models for
#' panel data, including time-varying predictors, time-invariant predictors and
#' random effects.
#'
#' @section Why mixed models are preferred over fixed effects models:
#'
#' A mixed models approach can model the causes of endogeneity explicitly
#' by including the (separated) within- and between-effects of time-varying
#' fixed effects and including time-constant fixed effects. Furthermore,
#' mixed models also include random effects, thus a mixed models approach
#' is superior to classic fixed-effects models, which lack information of
#' variation in the group-effects or between-subject effects. Furthermore,
#' fixed effects regression cannot include random slopes, which means that
#' fixed effects regressions are neglecting "cross-cluster differences in the
#' effects of lower-level controls (which) reduces the precision of estimated
#' context effects, resulting in unnecessarily wide confidence intervals and
#' low statistical power" (_Heisig et al. 2017_).
#'
#' @section Terminology:
#'
#' The group-meaned variable is simply the mean of an independent variable
#' within each group (or id-level or cluster) represented by `by`. It represents
#' the cluster-mean of an independent variable. The regression coefficient of a
#' group-meaned variable is the *between-subject-effect*. The de-meaned variable
#' is then the centered version of the group-meaned variable. De-meaning is
#' sometimes also called person-mean centering or centering within clusters.
#' The regression coefficient of a de-meaned variable represents the
#' *within-subject-effect*.
#'
#' @section De-meaning with continuous predictors:
#'
#' For continuous time-varying predictors, the recommendation is to include
#' both their de-meaned and group-meaned versions as fixed effects, but not
#' the raw (untransformed) time-varying predictors themselves. The de-meaned
#' predictor should also be included as random effect (random slope). In
#' regression models, the coefficient of the de-meaned predictors indicates
#' the within-subject effect, while the coefficient of the group-meaned
#' predictor indicates the between-subject effect.
#'
#' @section De-meaning with binary predictors:
#'
#' For binary time-varying predictors, there are two recommendations. First
#' is to include the raw (untransformed) binary predictor as fixed effect
#' only and the *de-meaned* variable as random effect (random slope).
#' The alternative would be to add the de-meaned version(s) of binary
#' time-varying covariates as additional fixed effect as well (instead of
#' adding it as random slope). Centering time-varying binary variables to
#' obtain within-effects (level 1) isn't necessary. They have a sensible
#' interpretation when left in the typical 0/1 format (_Hoffmann 2015,
#' chapter 8-2.I_). `demean()` will thus coerce categorical time-varying
#' predictors to numeric to compute the de- and group-meaned versions for
#' these variables, where the raw (untransformed) binary predictor and the
#' de-meaned version should be added to the model.
#'
#' @section De-meaning of factors with more than 2 levels:
#'
#' Factors with more than two levels are demeaned in two ways: first, these
#' are also converted to numeric and de-meaned; second, dummy variables
#' are created (binary, with 0/1 coding for each level) and these binary
#' dummy-variables are de-meaned in the same way (as described above).
#' Packages like **panelr** internally convert factors to dummies before
#' demeaning, so this behaviour can be mimicked here.
#'
#' @section De-meaning interaction terms:
#'
#' There are multiple ways to deal with interaction terms of within- and
#' between-effects.
#'
#' - A classical approach is to simply use the product term of the de-meaned
#'   variables (i.e. introducing the de-meaned variables as interaction term
#'   in the model formula, e.g. `y ~ x_within * time_within`). This approach,
#'   however, might be subject to bias (see _Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran 2020_).
#'
#' - Another option is to first calculate the product term and then apply the
#'   de-meaning to it. This approach produces an estimator "that reflects
#'   unit-level differences of interacted variables whose moderators vary
#'   within units", which is desirable if *no* within interaction of
#'   two time-dependent variables is required. This is what `demean()` does
#'   internally when `select` contains interaction terms.
#'
#' - A third option, when the interaction should result in a genuine within
#'   estimator, is to "double de-mean" the interaction terms
#'   (_Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran 2018_), however, this is currently
#'   not supported by `demean()`. If this is required, the `wmb()`
#'   function from the **panelr** package should be used.
#'
#' To de-mean interaction terms for within-between models, simply specify
#' the term as interaction for the `select`-argument, e.g. `select = "a*b"`
#' (see 'Examples').
#'
#' @section De-meaning for cross-classified designs:
#'
#' `demean()` can handle cross-classified designs, where the data has two or
#' more groups at the higher (i.e. second) level. In such cases, the
#' `by`-argument can identify two or more variables that represent the
#'  cross-classified group- or cluster-IDs. The de-meaned variables for
#' cross-classified designs are simply subtracting all group means from each
#' individual value, i.e. _fully cluster-mean-centering_ (see _Guo et al. 2024_
#' for details). Note that de-meaning for cross-classified designs is *not*
#' equivalent to de-meaning of nested data structures from models with three or
#' more levels. Set `nested = TRUE` to explicitly assume a nested design. For
#' cross-classified designs, de-meaning is supposed to work for models like
#' `y ~ x + (1|level3) + (1|level2)`, but *not* for models like
#' `y ~ x + (1|level3/level2)`. Note that `demean()` and `degroup()` can't
#' handle a mix of nested and cross-classified designs in one model.
#'
#' @section De-meaning for nested designs:
#'
#' _Brincks et al. (2017)_ have suggested an algorithm to center variables for
#' nested designs, which is implemented in `demean()`. For nested designs, set
#' `nested = TRUE` *and* specify the variables that indicate the different
#' levels in descending order in the `by` argument. E.g.,
#' `by = c("level4", "level3, "level2")` assumes a model like
#' `y ~ x + (1|level4/level3/level2)`. An alternative notation for the
#' `by`-argument would be `by = "level4/level3/level2"`, similar to the
#' formula notation.
#'
#' @section Analysing panel data with mixed models using lme4:
#'
#' A description of how to translate the formulas described in *Bell et al. 2018*
#' into R using `lmer()` from **lme4** can be found in
#' [this vignette](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/articles/demean.html).
