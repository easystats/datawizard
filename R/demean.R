#' Compute group-meaned and de-meaned variables
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `demean()` computes group- and de-meaned versions of a variable that can be
#' used in regression analysis to model the between- and within-subject effect.
#' `degroup()` is more generic in terms of the centering-operation. While
#' `demean()` always uses mean-centering, `degroup()` can also use the mode or
#' median for centering.
#'
#' @param x A data frame.
#' @param select Character vector (or formula) with names of variables to select
#'   that should be group- and de-meaned.
#' @param group Character vector (or formula) with the name of the variable that
#'   indicates the group- or cluster-ID.
#' @param center Method for centering. `demean()` always performs
#'   mean-centering, while `degroup()` can use `center = "median"` or
#'   `center = "mode"` for median- or mode-centering, and also `"min"`
#'   or `"max"`.
#' @param suffix_demean,suffix_groupmean String value, will be appended to the
#'   names of the group-meaned and de-meaned variables of `x`. By default,
#'   de-meaned variables will be suffixed with `"_within"` and
#'   grouped-meaned variables with `"_between"`.
#' @param add_attributes Logical, if `TRUE`, the returned variables gain
#'   attributes to indicate the within- and between-effects. This is only
#'   relevant when printing `model_parameters()` - in such cases, the
#'   within- and between-effects are printed in separated blocks.
#' @inheritParams center
#'
#' @return
#'
#' A data frame with the group-/de-meaned variables, which get the suffix
#' `"_between"` (for the group-meaned variable) and `"_within"` (for the
#' de-meaned variable) by default.
#'
#' @seealso If grand-mean centering (instead of centering within-clusters)
#'   is required, see [center()].

#'   \subsection{Heterogeneity Bias}{
#'     Mixed models include different levels of sources of variability, i.e.
#'     error terms at each level. When macro-indicators (or level-2 predictors,
#'     or higher-level units, or more general: *group-level predictors that
#'     **vary** within and across groups*) are included as fixed effects (i.e.
#'     treated as covariate at level-1), the variance that is left unaccounted for
#'     this covariate will be absorbed into the error terms of level-1 and level-2
#'     (\cite{Bafumi and Gelman 2006; Gelman and Hill 2007, Chapter 12.6.}):
#'     \dQuote{Such covariates contain two parts: one that is specific to the
#'     higher-level entity that does not vary between occasions, and one that
#'     represents the difference between occasions, within higher-level entities}
#'     (\cite{Bell et al. 2015}). Hence, the error terms will be correlated with
#'     the covariate, which violates one of the assumptions of mixed models
#'     (iid, independent and identically distributed error terms). This bias is
#'     also called the *heterogeneity bias* (\cite{Bell et al. 2015}). To
#'     resolve this problem, level-2 predictors used as (level-1) covariates should
#'     be separated into their "within" and "between" effects by "de-meaning" and
#'     "group-meaning": After demeaning time-varying predictors, \dQuote{at the
#'     higher level, the mean term is no longer constrained by Level 1 effects,
#'     so it is free to account for all the higher-level variance associated
#'     with that variable} (\cite{Bell et al. 2015}).
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{Panel data and correlating fixed and group effects}{
#'     `demean()` is intended to create group- and de-meaned variables
#'     for panel regression models (fixed effects models), or for complex
#'     random-effect-within-between models (see \cite{Bell et al. 2015, 2018}),
#'     where group-effects (random effects) and fixed effects correlate (see
#'     \cite{Bafumi and Gelman 2006}). This can happen, for instance, when
#'     analyzing panel data, which can lead to *Heterogeneity Bias*. To
#'     control for correlating predictors and group effects, it is recommended
#'     to include the group-meaned and de-meaned version of *time-varying covariates*
#'     (and group-meaned version of *time-invariant covariates* that are on
#'     a higher level, e.g. level-2 predictors) in the model. By this, one can
#'     fit complex multilevel models for panel data, including time-varying
#'     predictors, time-invariant predictors and random effects.
#'    }
#'
#'   \subsection{Why mixed models are preferred over fixed effects models}{
#'     A mixed models approach can model the causes of endogeneity explicitly
#'     by including the (separated) within- and between-effects of time-varying
#'     fixed effects and including time-constant fixed effects. Furthermore,
#'     mixed models also include random effects, thus a mixed models approach
#'     is superior to classic fixed-effects models, which lack information of
#'     variation in the group-effects or between-subject effects. Furthermore,
#'     fixed effects regression cannot include random slopes, which means that
#'     fixed effects regressions are neglecting \dQuote{cross-cluster differences
#'     in the effects of lower-level controls (which) reduces the precision of
#'     estimated context effects, resulting in unnecessarily wide confidence
#'     intervals and low statistical power} (\cite{Heisig et al. 2017}).
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{Terminology}{
#'     The group-meaned variable is simply the mean of an independent variable
#'     within each group (or id-level or cluster) represented by `group`.
#'     It represents the cluster-mean of an independent variable. The regression
#'     coefficient of a group-meaned variable is the *between-subject-effect*.
#'     The de-meaned variable is then the centered version of the group-meaned
#'     variable. De-meaning is sometimes also called person-mean centering or
#'     centering within clusters. The regression coefficient of a de-meaned
#'     variable represents the *within-subject-effect*.
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{De-meaning with continuous predictors}{
#'     For continuous time-varying predictors, the recommendation is to include
#'     both their de-meaned and group-meaned versions as fixed effects, but not
#'     the raw (untransformed) time-varying predictors themselves. The de-meaned
#'     predictor should also be included as random effect (random slope). In
#'     regression models, the coefficient of the de-meaned predictors indicates
#'     the within-subject effect, while the coefficient of the group-meaned
#'     predictor indicates the between-subject effect.
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{De-meaning with binary predictors}{
#'     For binary time-varying predictors, there are two recommendations. First
#'     is to include the raw (untransformed) binary predictor as fixed effect
#'     only and the *de-meaned* variable as random effect (random slope).
#'     The alternative would be to add the de-meaned version(s) of binary
#'     time-varying covariates as additional fixed effect as well (instead of
#'     adding it as random slope). Centering time-varying binary variables to
#'     obtain within-effects (level 1) isn't necessary. They have a sensible
#'     interpretation when left in the typical 0/1 format (\cite{Hoffmann 2015,
#'     chapter 8-2.I}). `demean()` will thus coerce categorical time-varying
#'     predictors to numeric to compute the de- and group-meaned versions for
#'     these variables, where the raw (untransformed) binary predictor and the
#'     de-meaned version should be added to the model.
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{De-meaning of factors with more than 2 levels}{
#'     Factors with more than two levels are demeaned in two ways: first, these
#'     are also converted to numeric and de-meaned; second, dummy variables
#'     are created (binary, with 0/1 coding for each level) and these binary
#'     dummy-variables are de-meaned in the same way (as described above).
#'     Packages like \pkg{panelr} internally convert factors to dummies before
#'     demeaning, so this behaviour can be mimicked here.
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{De-meaning interaction terms}{ There are multiple ways to deal
#'   with interaction terms of within- and between-effects. A classical approach
#'   is to simply use the product term of the de-meaned variables (i.e.
#'   introducing the de-meaned variables as interaction term in the model
#'   formula, e.g. `y ~ x_within * time_within`). This approach, however,
#'   might be subject to bias (see \cite{Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran 2020}).
#'     \cr \cr
#'     Another option is to first calculate the product term and then apply the
#'     de-meaning to it. This approach produces an estimator \dQuote{that reflects
#'     unit-level differences of interacted variables whose moderators vary
#'     within units}, which is desirable if *no* within interaction of
#'     two time-dependent variables is required. \cr \cr
#'     A third option, when the interaction should result in a genuine within
#'     estimator, is to "double de-mean" the interaction terms
#'     (\cite{Giesselmann & Schmidt-Catran 2018}), however, this is currently
#'     not supported by `demean()`. If this is required, the `wmb()`
#'     function from the \pkg{panelr} package should be used. \cr \cr
#'     To de-mean interaction terms for within-between models, simply specify
#'     the term as interaction for the `select`-argument, e.g.
#'     `select = "a*b"` (see 'Examples').
#'   }
#'
#'   \subsection{Analysing panel data with mixed models using lme4}{
#'     A description of how to translate the
#'     formulas described in *Bell et al. 2018* into R using `lmer()`
#'     from \pkg{lme4} can be found in
#'     [this vignette](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/articles/demean.html).
