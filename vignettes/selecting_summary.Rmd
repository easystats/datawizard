# Selecting variables

## Quoted names

This is the most simple way to select one or several variables. Just use a character
vector containing variables names, like in base R.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Width"))
```

## Unquoted names

It is also possible to use unquoted names. This is useful if you use the `tidyverse`
and want to be consistent about the way variable names are passed.

```{r}
iris |> 
  group_by(Species) |> 
  standardise(Petal.Length) |> 
  ungroup()
```


## Formulas

[FIND USE CASE]

```{r}
get_columns(iris, ~ Sepal.Length + Petal.Width)
```



## Positions

In addition to variable names, `select` can also take a numeric vector that indicates
the position of the variables to select in the dataframe.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, c(1, 2, 5))
```


## Functions

You can pass a function to `select`. This function will be applied to all columns
and has to return `TRUE` or `FALSE`. For example, if you want to keep only numeric
columns, you can use `is.numeric`.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, is.numeric)
```

Note that you can also define your own functions and pass them in `select`, 
*as long as they return `TRUE` or `FALSE`* when applied to a column.

```{r}
my_function <- function(i) {
  is.numeric(i) && mean(i, na.rm = TRUE) > 3.5
}

get_columns(iris, my_function)
```


## Patterns

Most of the time, our data will be quite bigger than `iris`. It would be tedious
to write the names of variables we want to select, and it would be fragile to rely
on variable positions in the dataset as they may change later. In this case, you
can use four select helpers: `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, and
`regex()`. The former three can take several patterns, while the latter takes
a single regular expression.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, starts_with("Sep", "Peta"))

get_columns(iris, ends_with("dth", "ies"))

get_columns(iris, contains("pal", "ec"))

get_columns(iris, regex("^Sep|ies"))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
row("Note: these functions are not exported by `datawizard` but are detected and
applied internally. This means that they won't be detected by autocompletion
when you write them.")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
row("Note #2: because these functions are not exported, they will not create conflicts
with the ones that come from the `tidyverse` and that have the same name. So you
can still use `dplyr` and its friends, it won't change anything for selection in 
`datawizard` functions!")
```


# Excluding variables

What if you want to keep all variables except for a few ones? There are two ways
you can invert your selection.

The first way is to put a minus sign `"-"` in front of the `select` argument.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, -c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Width"))

get_columns(iris, -starts_with("Sep", "Peta"))
```

The second way is to use the argument `exclude`. This argument has the same 
possibilities as `select`. Note that you can use both `select` and `exclude` at 
the same time.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, exclude = c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Width"))

get_columns(iris, exclude = starts_with("Sep", "Peta"))
```



# Programming with selections

TODO

# Useful to know

## Ignore the case

In every selection that uses variable names, you can ignore the case in the 
selection by applying `ignore_case = TRUE`.

```{r}
get_columns(iris, c("sepal.length", "petal.width"), ignore_case = TRUE)

get_columns(iris, ~ Sepal.length + petal.Width, ignore_case = TRUE)

get_columns(iris, starts_with("sep", "peta"), ignore_case = TRUE)
```
