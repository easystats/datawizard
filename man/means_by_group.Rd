\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or a data frame.}

\item{...}{Currently not used}

\item{by}{If \code{x} is a numeric vector, \code{by} should be a factor that
indicates the group-classifying categories. If \code{x} is a data frame, \code{by}
should be a character string, naming the variable in \code{x} that is used for
grouping. Numeric vectors are coerced to factors. Not that \code{by} should
only refer to a single variable.}

\item{ci}{Level of confidence interval for mean estimates. Default is \code{0.95}.
Use \code{ci = NA} to suppress confidence intervals.}

\item{weights}{If \code{x} is a numeric vector, \code{weights} should be a vector of
weights that will be applied to weight all observations. If \code{x} is a data
frame, \code{weights} can also be a character string indicating the name of the
variable in \code{x} that should be used for weighting. Default is \code{NULL}, so no
weights are used.}

\item{digits}{Optional scalar, indicating the amount of digits after decimal
point when rounding estimates and values.}

\item{select}{Variables that will be included when performing the required
tasks. Can be either
\itemize{
\item a variable specified as a literal variable name (e.g., \code{column_name}),
\item a string with the variable name (e.g., \code{"column_name"}), a character
vector of variable names (e.g., \code{c("col1", "col2", "col3")}), or a
character vector of variable names including ranges specified via \code{:}
(e.g., \code{c("col1:col3", "col5")}),
\item for some functions, like \code{data_select()} or \code{data_rename()}, \code{select} can
be a named character vector. In this case, the names are used to rename
the columns in the output data frame. See 'Details' in the related
functions to see where this option applies.
\item a formula with variable names (e.g., \code{~column_1 + column_2}),
\item a vector of positive integers, giving the positions counting from the left
(e.g. \code{1} or \code{c(1, 3, 5)}),
\item a vector of negative integers, giving the positions counting from the
right (e.g., \code{-1} or \code{-1:-3}),
\item one of the following select-helpers: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()},
\code{contains()}, a range using \code{:}, or \code{regex()}. \code{starts_with()},
\code{ends_with()}, and  \code{contains()} accept several patterns, e.g
\code{starts_with("Sep", "Petal")}. \code{regex()} can be used to define regular
expression patterns.
\item a function testing for logical conditions, e.g. \code{is.numeric()} (or
\code{is.numeric}), or any user-defined function that selects the variables
for which the function returns \code{TRUE} (like: \code{foo <- function(x) mean(x) > 3}),
\item ranges specified via literal variable names, select-helpers (except
\code{regex()}) and (user-defined) functions can be negated, i.e. return
non-matching elements, when prefixed with a \code{-}, e.g. \code{-ends_with()},
\code{-is.numeric} or \code{-(Sepal.Width:Petal.Length)}. \strong{Note:} Negation means
that matches are \emph{excluded}, and thus, the \code{exclude} argument can be
used alternatively. For instance, \code{select=-ends_with("Length")} (with
\code{-}) is equivalent to \code{exclude=ends_with("Length")} (no \code{-}). In case
negation should not work as expected, use the \code{exclude} argument instead.
}

If \code{NULL}, selects all columns. Patterns that found no matches are silently
ignored, e.g. \code{extract_column_names(iris, select = c("Species", "Test"))}
will just return \code{"Species"}.}

\item{exclude}{See \code{select}, however, column names matched by the pattern
from \code{exclude} will be excluded instead of selected. If \code{NULL} (the default),
excludes no columns.}

\item{ignore_case}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} and when one of the select-helpers or
a regular expression is used in \code{select}, ignores lower/upper case in the
search pattern when matching against variable names.}

\item{regex}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the search pattern from \code{select} will be
treated as regular expression. When \code{regex = TRUE}, select \emph{must} be a
character string (or a variable containing a character string) and is not
allowed to be one of the supported select-helpers or a character vector
of length > 1. \code{regex = TRUE} is comparable to using one of the two
select-helpers, \code{select = contains()} or \code{select = regex()}, however,
since the select-helpers may not work when called from inside other
functions (see 'Details'), this argument may be used as workaround.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings.}
}
\value{
A data frame with information on mean and further summary statistics
for each sub-group.
}
\description{
Computes summary table of means by groups.
}
\details{
This function is comparable to \code{aggregate(x, by, mean)}, but provides
some further information, including summary statistics from a One-Way-ANOVA
using \code{x} as dependent and \code{by} as independent variable. \code{\link[emmeans:contrast]{emmeans::contrast()}}
is used to get p-values for each sub-group. P-values indicate whether each
group-mean is significantly different from the total mean.

data(efc)
means_by_group(efc, "c12hour", "e42dep")

data(iris)
means_by_group(iris, "Sepal.Width", "Species")

# weighting
efc$weight <- abs(rnorm(n = nrow(efc), mean = 1, sd = .5))
