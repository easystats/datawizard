\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{expand}{The name of the column that contains the counts of replications
for each row. Can also be a numeric value, indicating the position of that
column. Note that the variable indicated by \code{expand} must be an integer vector.}

\item{select}{Variables that will be included when performing the required
tasks. Can be either
\itemize{
\item a variable specified as a literal variable name (e.g., \code{column_name}),
\item a string with the variable name (e.g., \code{"column_name"}), a character
vector of variable names (e.g., \code{c("col1", "col2", "col3")}), or a
character vector of variable names including ranges specified via \code{:}
(e.g., \code{c("col1:col3", "col5")}),
\item for some functions, like \code{data_select()} or \code{data_rename()}, \code{select} can
be a named character vector. In this case, the names are used to rename
the columns in the output data frame. See 'Details' in the related
functions to see where this option applies.
\item a formula with variable names (e.g., \code{~column_1 + column_2}),
\item a vector of positive integers, giving the positions counting from the left
(e.g. \code{1} or \code{c(1, 3, 5)}),
\item a vector of negative integers, giving the positions counting from the
right (e.g., \code{-1} or \code{-1:-3}),
\item one of the following select-helpers: \code{starts_with()}, \code{ends_with()},
\code{contains()}, a range using \code{:}, or \code{regex()}. \code{starts_with()},
\code{ends_with()}, and  \code{contains()} accept several patterns, e.g
\code{starts_with("Sep", "Petal")}. \code{regex()} can be used to define regular
expression patterns.
\item a function testing for logical conditions, e.g. \code{is.numeric()} (or
\code{is.numeric}), or any user-defined function that selects the variables
for which the function returns \code{TRUE} (like: \code{foo <- function(x) mean(x) > 3}),
\item ranges specified via literal variable names, select-helpers (except
\code{regex()}) and (user-defined) functions can be negated, i.e. return
non-matching elements, when prefixed with a \code{-}, e.g. \code{-ends_with()},
\code{-is.numeric} or \code{-(Sepal.Width:Petal.Length)}. \strong{Note:} Negation means
that matches are \emph{excluded}, and thus, the \code{exclude} argument can be
used alternatively. For instance, \code{select=-ends_with("Length")} (with
\code{-}) is equivalent to \code{exclude=ends_with("Length")} (no \code{-}). In case
negation should not work as expected, use the \code{exclude} argument instead.
}

If \code{NULL}, selects all columns. Patterns that found no matches are silently
ignored, e.g. \code{extract_column_names(iris, select = c("Species", "Test"))}
will just return \code{"Species"}.}

\item{exclude}{See \code{select}, however, column names matched by the pattern
from \code{exclude} will be excluded instead of selected. If \code{NULL} (the default),
excludes no columns.}

\item{remove_na}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, missing values in the column
provided in \code{expand} are removed from the data frame. If \code{FALSE} and \code{expand}
contains missing values, the function will throw an error.}

\item{ignore_case}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} and when one of the select-helpers or
a regular expression is used in \code{select}, ignores lower/upper case in the
search pattern when matching against variable names.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings.}

\item{regex}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the search pattern from \code{select} will be
treated as regular expression. When \code{regex = TRUE}, select \emph{must} be a
character string (or a variable containing a character string) and is not
allowed to be one of the supported select-helpers or a character vector
of length > 1. \code{regex = TRUE} is comparable to using one of the two
select-helpers, \code{select = contains()} or \code{select = regex()}, however,
since the select-helpers may not work when called from inside other
functions (see 'Details'), this argument may be used as workaround.}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with each row replicated as many times as defined in \code{expand}.
}
\description{
Expand a data frame by replicating rows based on another variable that
contains the counts of replications per row.

\examples{
data(mtcars)
data_replicate(head(mtcars), "carb")
