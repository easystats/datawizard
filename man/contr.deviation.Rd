\title{Deviation Contrast Matrix}
\usage{
contr.deviation(n, base = 1, contrasts = TRUE, sparse = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{a vector of levels for a factor, or the number of levels.}

\item{base}{an integer specifying which group is considered the
    baseline group. Ignored if \code{contrasts} is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{contrasts}{a logical indicating whether contrasts should be
    computed.}

\item{sparse}{logical indicating if the result should be sparse
    (of class \code{\link[Matrix:dgCMatrix-class]{dgCMatrix}}), using
    package \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Matrix}{\pkg{Matrix}}.}

\description{
Build a deviation contrast matrix, a type of \emph{effects contrast} matrix.
}
\details{
In effects coding, unlike treatment/dummy coding
(\code{\link[stats:contrast]{stats::contr.treatment()}}), each contrast sums to 0. In regressions models,
this results in an intercept that represents the (unweighted) average of the
group means. In ANOVA settings, this also guarantees that lower order effects
represent \emph{main} effects (and not \emph{simple} or \emph{conditional} effects, as is
the case when using R's default \code{\link[stats:contrast]{stats::contr.treatment()}}).
\cr\cr
Deviation coding (\code{contr.deviation}) is a type of effects coding. With
deviation coding, the coefficients for factor variables are interpreted as
the difference of each factor level from the base level (this is the same
interpretation as with treatment/dummy coding). For example, for a factor
\code{group} with levels "A", "B", and "C", with \code{contr.devation}, the intercept
represents the overall mean (average of the group means for the 3 groups),
and the coefficients \code{groupB} and \code{groupC} represent the differences between
the A group mean and the B and C group means, respectively.
\cr\cr
Sum coding (\code{\link[stats:contrast]{stats::contr.sum()}}) is another type of effects coding. With sum
coding, the coefficients for factor variables are interpreted as the
difference of each factor level from \strong{the grand (across-groups) mean}. For
example, for a factor \code{group} with levels "A", "B", and "C", with
\code{contr.sum}, the intercept represents the overall mean (average of the group
means for the 3 groups), and the coefficients \code{group1} and \code{group2} represent
the differences the
\strong{A} and \strong{B} group means from the overall mean, respectively.
