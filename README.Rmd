***Hockety pockety wockety wack, prepare this data forth and back*** :sparkles:

# Features

## Data wrangling 

### Select and filter

The package provides helpers to select columns or filter rows meeting certain conditions:

```{r}
matching_rows <- data_match(mtcars, data.frame(vs = 0, am = 1))
mtcars[matching_rows, ]
```

Or do other manipulations:

```{r}
head(data_addprefix(iris, "NEW_"))
```


### Transform

The packages also contains multiple functions to help transform data.

For example, to standardize (*z*-score) data:

```{r}
# before
summary(swiss)

# after
summary(standardize(swiss))
```

To winsorize data:

```{r}
# before
anscombe

# after
winsorize(anscombe)
```

To grand-mean center data

```{r}
center(anscombe)
```

To rank-transform data:

```{r}
# before
head(trees)

# after
head(ranktransform(trees))
```

To rescale a numeric variable to a new range:

```{r}
data_rescale(c(0, 1, 5, -5, -2))
```

### Reshape

A common data wrangling task is to reshape data.

Either to go from wide/Cartesian to long/tidy format

```{r}
library(datawizard)

wide_data <- data.frame(replicate(5, rnorm(10)))

data_to_long(wide_data)
```

or the other way

```{r}
long_data <- data_to_long(wide_data, rows_to = "Row_ID") # Save row number

data_to_wide(long_data,
  colnames_from = "Name",
  values_from = "Value",
  rows_from = "Row_ID"
)
```

## Data proprties

`datawizard` provides a way to provide comprehensive descriptive summary for all variables in a dataframe:

```{r}
data(iris)
describe_distribution(iris)
```

Or even just a variable

```{r}
describe_distribution(mtcars$wt)
```

There are also some additional data properties that can be computed using this package.

```{r}
x <- (-10:10)^3 + rnorm(21, 0, 100)
smoothness(x, method = "diff")
```
