Variable `Component` is not in your data frame :/
No variable was specified for contrast estimation. Selecting `contrast = "Species"`.
We selected `at = c("Species")`.
Possible multicollinearity between Petal.Width:Speciesversicolor and Petal.Width (r = 0.86), Petal.Width:Speciesversicolor and Speciesversicolor (r = 0.71), Petal.Width:Speciesvirginica and Petal.Width:Speciesversicolor (r = 0.8). This might lead to inappropriate results. See 'Details' in '?rope'.
Sampling priors, please wait...
