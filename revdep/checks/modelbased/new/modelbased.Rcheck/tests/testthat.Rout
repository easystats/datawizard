This is rstanarm version 2.21.3
- See https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/priors for changes to default priors!
- Default priors may change, so it's safest to specify priors, even if equivalent to the defaults.
- For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
  options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
